# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

change the header of the app to "OneFLex | Fast Smooth Free Streaming"
change "flter sortby items per page" section into an icon, that icon will show the full menu with responsive ui design
the 16 items all folder fies count size will be bottom section of the page
the back button when pressing on browser redirects to "sign in page" but i need back button just goes to back folder previous, if in video player the back actions will do "go to previous folder it was before playing video"

All changes are responsive and maintain existing dark theme design. Added proper CSS styling for the new filters button across all screen sizes. FIXED: Removed duplicate filters - completely removed the original hamburger menu with 'Filters' text from FileExplorer component and moved all filter functionality to the header icon. The filters now properly toggle from the header button and show a clean dropdown with all filter controls (file type, sort options, page size). SCROLLING IMPROVEMENTS: Fixed double scrolling issue by removing separate scrolling from file browsing section - now uses single page scroll for better UX. Added floating scroll-to-top button that appears when user scrolls down 300px, with smooth scroll animation and responsive design for mobile devices."

      message: "Completed testing of all backend endpoints. All endpoints are implemented correctly. The health check endpoint works without authentication. All other endpoints correctly require authentication. In the test environment, we can't fully test the authenticated endpoints since we don't have actual Microsoft Graph API tokens, but we verified they are implemented and return the expected error codes when authentication is missing."

      message: "Fixed Microsoft OAuth authentication flow. Issues fixed: 1) Redirect URI was hardcoded to localhost instead of production URL, 2) Callback endpoint was returning JSON instead of redirecting to frontend, 3) Missing httpcore dependency, 4) Frontend was trying to handle callback instead of URL parameters. Now the OAuth flow should work properly in production environment."
    - agent: "testing"
      message: "Completed testing of the OAuth flow fixes. Verified that: 1) The redirect URI is correctly set to the production URL, 2) The callback endpoint properly redirects to the frontend with access token or error message, 3) The httpcore dependency is included in requirements.txt, 4) All other endpoints still work as expected. The OAuth flow configuration is now correct for the production environment."

COMPLETED: 1) Fixed MKV MIME type from incorrect 'video/mp4' to proper 'video/x-matroska' for correct browser identification, 2) Enhanced streaming response headers specifically for MKV files with browser compatibility headers, 3) Added optimized chunking for MKV files with smaller chunk sizes for better streaming performance, 4) Implemented comprehensive error handling in frontend with specific MKV error messages and browser guidance, 5) Added video element attributes (preload, crossOrigin, playsInline) for better MKV support, 6) Enhanced error detection to identify MKV files and provide browser-specific guidance. This should resolve MKV playback issues in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers."

      message: "USER REQUEST: Fix navigation issue where going back from video player goes to home directory instead of current directory. COMPLETED: 1) Added currentFolder state to App component to properly track the current directory across view changes, 2) Modified FileExplorer component to accept currentFolder and onFolderChange props for state synchronization, 3) Updated navigation functions (navigateToFolder, handleBreadcrumbClick) to notify parent component of folder changes, 4) Modified handleBackToExplorer to preserve currentFolder state so users return to the same directory they were browsing, 5) Added proper state synchronization between App and FileExplorer components. This ensures that when users go back from video/audio/photo players, they return to the exact folder they were browsing instead of being taken to the home directory."
